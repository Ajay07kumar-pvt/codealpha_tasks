#  CodeAlpha Data Science Internship  
## Task 1: Iris Flower Classification  

###  Project Overview  
This project is part of my *CodeAlpha Data Science Internship*.  
The aim is to classify *Iris flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)* using features like sepal and petal dimensions.  

This task demonstrates the basics of *supervised machine learning classification* using the Iris dataset.

###  Key Objectives
- Load and explore the Iris dataset  
- Visualize relationships between flower measurements  
- Train and evaluate a machine learning classification model  
- Measure model accuracy and performance  

---

###  Tools & Libraries Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  

---

### Workflow
1. Load the Iris dataset  
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
3. Split data into train/test sets  
4. Train a classifier (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree)  
5. Evaluate model accuracy and visualize results

### Results
- Achieved high classification accuracy (>95%)  
- Built a simple yet powerful predictive model  
- Learned key ML concepts like feature scaling and model evaluation
